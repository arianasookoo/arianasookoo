**/ get to know me**<br>

<p align='left'>I'm an international student from Trinidad and Tobago, currently entering my junior year at Penn State University, where I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Outside of coding in VS Code, I enjoy reading, graphic design, video editing, and working out.

My passion for a career in User Interface and User Experience Design is fueled by my interest in the intersection of technology and purpose-driven innovation. I believe the impact of any digital solution hinges on how intuitively and meaningfully it connects with its users. Without thoughtful delivery, even the most promising ideas can fall flat.

I love combining creativity with code. Side projects keep me curious and motivated, helping me build the skills I need for a future in software development with cutting-edge tools. I'm constantly learning, whether it's from my engineering peers or by exploring the ethics and psychology behind tech design. With every project, I aim to craft user experiences that are intuitive, inclusive, and built to evolve.</p>
